    "Define:\n",
    "* A moving average is obtained by taking the average of consecutive data points, which helps to reduce noise and fluctuations in the data, resulting in a smoother curve. \n",
    "* A moving average is computed using a sliding window, where the window's size is determined by the chosen time interval or period.\n",
    "* For instance, in the case of daily stock price data, you could opt for a 10-day moving window. This implies that when calculating the average, the preceding 10 days' worth of data would be taken into account.\n",
    "* If you have an ordered sequence $\\left\\{ x_1,x_2,x_3,\\cdots ,x_N \\right\\}$ and you want to compute a moving average sequence $MA$ with a sliding window size $s$, here's a `formula` of the process: $$ MA_i=\\frac{x_{i-s+1}+x_{i-s+2}+\\cdots +x_i}{s}\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\forall i\\in \\mathbb{Z},\\ s-1\\le i\\le N $$ The sequence $ \\left\\{ MA_i|\\forall i\\in \\mathbb{Z},\\,\\,1\\le i<s-1 \\right\\}  $ contains default values, which is normal. You can either leave it as is without any adjustments or take it into consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What should you do?\n",
    "* You must refer the doc of [numpy.convolve](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.convolve.html#numpy-convolve)\n",
    "* You need to gradually implement the following steps and obtain the correct output"
